# Superhero Maze

In this project, I used Pyret to program a game in which the user navigates the maze with a superhero. Each move causes the hero's stamina to decrease slightly. Moving over certain items can cause the hero's stamina to decrease or increase significantly. The superhero must reach the computer before their stamina reaches zero to win the game.

**Concepts Used**

- Datatypes
- Recursion
- Reactors
